1) What is the mass of a photon?
Photons are traditionally said to be massless.
2) What is the size of a quark?
A quark has never demonstrated any measurable size.
3) What is the difference between electrical charge and color charge?
Electrical charge is electron but color charge is photon.
4) Explain the difference between a boson and a fermion?
Boson can be quantum, and fermion can't.
5) Describe what type of particle is both a boson and a hadron.  Give and example.
Meson
6) Explain the purpose of a bubble chamber.
bubble chamber, device for detecting charged particles and other radiation by means of tracks of bubbles left in a chamber filled with liquid hydrogen or other liquefied gas
7) What are leptons made of?
Matter is made up of atoms, and atoms are made of electrons and nuclei, bound by the electromagnetic force.
8) Name two leptons and two baryons.
Leptons: electric charge, spin. Baryons: down quark. up quark.
9) Explain what quantities are conserved at each vertex of a Feynmenn diagram.
While the diagrams are applied primarily to quantum field theory, they can also be used in other fields, such as solid-state theory.
10) Explain what an "exchange particle" is.  Describe its function and provide an example.
Gluons are the exchange particles for the color force between quarks, analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles
